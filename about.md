I’m a computer scientist passionate about working on AI for the real world. Currently, I am working towards achieving VR social telepresence at <a href="https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/" target="_blank">Meta Reality Labs</a>. Before that, I did research at <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/" target="_blank">Microsoft Research</a>. 
<br>
I am also the creator of <a href="https://liner.ai/"  >Liner.ai</a> - a one-click tool for training ML models.  I’ve created open source tools which are used by thousands of people.  In my free time, I experiment with art and music production.

Have a look at my <a href="https://bit.ly/divamcv">resume</a> for more information.
